      <p>Isaac Asimov was a Russian-born, American author,
        a professor of biochemistry, and a highly successful writer,
        best known for his works of science fiction and
        for his popular science books. Professor Asimov is generally
        considered one of the most prolific writers of all time,
        having written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated
        90,000 letters and postcards. He has works published in nine of the ten
         major categories of the Dewey Decimal System (lacking only an entry
         in the 100s category of Philosophy). </p>
      <p> Many believe Asimov's greatest talent was for, as he called it,
        "translating" science, making it understandable and interesting for
         the average reader. An often quoted bit of his genius is his
         3 laws of Robotics, which quoted from his short story Runaround
         found in the collection I,Robot.<p>
      <ol>
        <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction,
          allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
        <li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except
          where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
        <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such
          protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li>
      </ol>
